					<h3 class="center-align">Usability</h3>
					<p class="flow-text" style="font-size: 1rem;">
						The usability of quick response (QR) codes. QR codes are a very common appearance but are they fit-for-purpose or well used? Does the use of QR code functionality make a mobile application more usable? Usability tests identify areas where people struggle with a product and help you make recommendations for improvements for the applications. The goal is to better understand how real users interact with QR code and to improve interaction between users and the QR code. Since "usability testing employs real users accomplishing real tasks, it can provide objective performance data" (TechSmith, 2017) and allow observations on the users to help improve and enhance the interaction between the users and how to use the QR code.
					</p>
					<h3 class="center-align">Data Collecting</h3>
					<p class="flow-text center-align" style="font-size: 1rem;">
						In order to gather the data required we will conduct a number of interviews/experiments regarding the QR codes. We have interviewed a number of people from a broad demographic in terms of age, gender and educational background. Each interview is a verbal
						(audio recorded) 1-2 minute questionnaire of open-ended questions (audio files below).
						In order to gather the data required we will conduct a number of interviews/experiments regarding the QR codes. Interviews are both qualitative and quantitative. <br/>We have interviewed a number of people from a broad demographic in terms of age, gender and educational background. Each interview is a verbal (audio recorded) 1-2 minute questionnaire of open-ended questions (audio files below).
						Using open-ended and reasonably context-free questions allow us to gather data from interviewees without any interference or influence such as unintentionally pushing interviewees towards an answer we want or interviewees seeing the interview as a 'test', changing their answers to score well. <br/>This also allowed us to gather more information with an infinite set of possible answers. Open-ended questions are more suitable in relation to the usability of QR codes however, requires more effort to analyse the data. (<a href="nngroup.com/articles/open-ended-questions">Open Ended Questions Article We Researched</a>).

					</p>
					<h3 class="center-align">Adoption</h3>
					<p class="flow-text center-align" style="font-size: 1rem;">
						In order for an interaction technique to be successfully adopted by a wide range of people, three conditions must be met, (Cheng, Y. and Budiu, R.):
						<ul class="collection">
							<li class="collection-item">Usefulness: The technique must provide some sort of benefit. Useless innovations are a dead-end. </li>
							<li class="collection-item"> Ease of use: This technique has to provide some sort of benefit in terms of the learning curve and the usability of the technique once it is learnt. If the learning curve is too great or mastery of the technique requires time/effort, most will
								give up.</li>
							<li class="collection-item"> Discoverability: The technique/technology must be discoverable by a wide population. Many useful inventions have simply been lost because of the lack of numbers to support such techniques.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h3 class="center-align">Why we chose Quick Response Codes</h3>
					<p class="flow-text center-align" style="font-size: 1rem;">
						The reason that we as a team chose to research into QR codes is that we feel that they can utilize a powerful functionality through vision to convey meaningful information. However, the way in which they are accessed through an application is pivotal to the success of the QR feature.
						They have seen very common use in Asia, "QR Codes are part of daily life in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China" says (Rouillard, 2008). As well as the interesting truth of what (Chang, Jung & Shin, 2012) discussed around how one of the main weaknesses of QR codes is their limited interactivity. As it is required to have access to a smartphone to be able to consistently use QR codes they are unusable to a vast amount of the population. The codes's themselves don't speak to consumers and the consumers have to unveil the curtain, so to speak, to access the information that the code contains. This fact got us interested in how people where using QR Codes and whether they found that they used them commonly within mobile applications.

					<h2 class="center-align flow-text">#1 Interview</h2>
					<p class="center-align">The goal of the interview is to get an understanding of how different people would respond to a set of interview questions around QR Codes.<br/>We planned with these questions to get a general understanding of whether our sample group knew about and how to use QR Code and in for what function they would use them for.</p>
					<h4 class="center-align">Questions:</h4>
				  <ul class="collection center-align">
				 	<li class="collection-item">Do you know what this is? (Shows image of QR code)</li>
				 	<li class="collection-item">How do you think it looks?</li>
				 	<li class="collection-item">How would you use this?</li>
				 	<li class="collection-item">Are you a regular user of apps on your phone?</li>
				 	<li class="collection-item">What are your most-used apps?</li>
				 	<li class="collection-item">Do you use QR codes in any mobile application?</li>
				 	<li class="collection-item">If so, what? And for what purpose?</li>
				</ul>


					<h2 class="center-align flow-text">#2 Usability (Test) Speed</h2>
					<p class="center-align">After conducting some interviews we thought it would be useful to get users to perform a simple task in two applications that use QR Codes.<br/>So we asked users to find the QR function contained within Snapchat and Messenger to add new friends.</p>
				<ul class="collection center-align">
				 	<li class="collection-item">First the interviewee would be given Andre's iPhone.</li>
					<li class="collection-item">Ask them to navigate to the snapchat and messenger applications and to stay within each app for between 30 seconds and 1 minute.</li>
					<li class="collection-item">Ask them to navigate to the home screen of the iphone</li>
					<li class="collection-item">Then hand them this <a href="Which App Has Faster Usablity.pdf">document</a>.</li>
					<li class="collection-item">Observations would be to see firstly which app they chose to enter first.</li>

					<p>The first experiment clearly shows that the majority of people interviewed are aware of what a quick response code is and how to use it, yet
						barely used them. Another obvious finding, given the data, is that age has a significant impact as to whether or not they are familiar with QR codes or are aware of what they are.
						This was already assumed by the team before undergoing the research.

						Our second experiment revealed how it was more common for users to know how to navigate Snapchat in comparison to Facebook Messenger. It seemed that of our 3 participants 2 where accustomed to Android devices an felt that the application behaved differently on the Apple Device.
						We found that people generally favour Snapchat 'Stories' over Messenger/Facebook stories. Many people from both this and the first experiment had used QR codes within Snapchat to add friends but had never used them to do the same in Messenger. This we believe validates our many goal that QR codes can have highly usable functionality within mobile applications. But, it depends heavily on how intuitive it is to find and use, as well as whether the users of the application want to use a QR code to complete that function.

					<h6 class="center-align flow-text">Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences - Computational Intelligence & Software Development</h6>
					<p class="flow-text center-align" style="font-size: 12pt">I am a technical person who has been interning at Air New Zealand for the past year developing mobile and web applications as well as doing data science in this role. I only got into programming in the first year of my degree but i have taken to it like a moth to a flame. The degree here at AUT has been the best decision of my life. As i feel i have been exposed to many mentors that have allowed me to excel in statistics and picking up plenty of new technical skills. I find I am a lot more outgoing in comparison to some of my other friends I have from within tech and this I feel has made me have to step up as a leader in many of my group assignments. I have found that as the number of group assignments have gone up it has been very pressuring for me to keep all parties happy from all the group assignments, to work as well as to extra external clients. This has lead me to have very precise communication skills and I find I won't stand for people beating around the bush. Throughout my past years at AUT I have learned that one of the key areas I have needed to work on has been the ability to be empathetic as I feel I can often be intimidating to converse with. I think that I come across to others as having a very strong frame and principles, but i feel that while learning a lot the pressures from the degree as well as work have not allowed me to dedicate my time to excelling in either of these areas. I think that with the role I played in this team is that I was looked to for leadership but I found it difficult to lead well due to pressures from other priorities. However I think that when it came to crunch time I have been able to direct the team to produce some interesting research.
						<br/><br/>
This assignment was a bit different to prior assignments I have done at AUT, similar in a way to the first assignment. I find it difficult to think in such a way that takes into consideration the end user. However over the past year through projects with clients, this paper and as well as being exposed to the User Experience department at work I have begun to understand the importance of knowing the way that users feel about and use a system. Through this assignment, I was exposed to my first experiences of usability studies with a goal of understanding the users of a particular technology, in this case, QR Codes. I found it very interesting in the lectures when the discussion was around how bad questions would anchor users and how to ask questions in a way such that you wouldn't prompt them to alter the way they are feeling about a product/technology. I tried to incorporate what I learned from the lectures about anchoring into my interviews with users so that my questions would be more open to trying to make the interviewee comfortable in sharing their true thoughts on a technology.
<br/><br/>
In regards to how our team performed I believe we have all been under vast amounts of pressure from our R & D Projects as well just the fact of this semester being all of our last set of papers in our degrees. I feel that this lead to us procrastinating getting started on this particular assignment in a preemptive manner, which made it difficult for us to come up with some better usability experiments. However, I feel that the topic we have researched is very interesting and I think QR Codes, especially within mobile apps need to be structured in the right way to make the applications experience benefit from including functionality involving QR Codes.
<br/><br/>
I found that in some of my interviews I would accidentally break frame to help the interviewee's with awkward situations but in doing so I would anchor their forthcoming responses. I have learned from this that having more open session interviews where you keep the questions very few and open will allow me to not have to fill gaps to which will anchor users. And will allow the users to discuss their thoughts in more depth and granularity. Where the experiments would be based on observing how users naturally use a technology rather than the interview format we conducted which I felt masked many of the intricacies around how users interacted with QR Codes. I will take this learning into my user testings at work next week where I hope to watch users play with some of my own software (an iOS app) to see how they will try to bend and break it. This openness in trying to understand how users will naturally use a system or software tool I believe will enable me to build more intuitive and usable systems.
<br/><br/>
Going forward, employing the practices and methods I have learned in this course will be vital to my success in my internship and my hopefully long career in technology. I know that user-led design and being user-centric are becoming very important within the industry and with helping to build better products. I feel that this assignment has been the first step into understanding the real ways of testing a technology's usability. I understand that I feel quite differently about usability in comparison to a regular user, in that I prefer my tools to be within a terminal with clear documentation, whereas a general user just wants to intuitively know how to use a new tool. But learning this has been a transformation I have been beginning to undertake thanks to the likes of this course, talented UX colleagues I am exposed to and the rise of user led design.

							<p class="flow-text center-align" style="font-size: 12pt">I’ve always had a passion for programming as it allows me to explore my creativity and develop/produce work I can share and be proud of. I chose to go to university to learn the skills I need in order to create applications. Instead I learnt so much more than what I thought I was capable of. The most important things being the ability to learn, being open-minded and how to productively and efficiently work individually and in a team. <br>
							<br>
							From my perspective this assignment went well overall. I thought the topic of QR codes was interesting and I was eager to find out what people thought of the functionality and the usability of QR codes. Prior to this assignment I did not know a considerable amount of information about QR codes. However, I was always curious as to why QR codes aren’t as widely used. They’re convenient and seem to serve a much greater purpose in comparison to their relative, barcodes. Throughout the duration of this experiment, it became clear that many people just simply knew of QR codes but never went the extra step into trying them. I believe this is due to the fact that almost all smart phones do not come with a built in QR code reader as part of the cameras functionality. Only the latest update of iOS 11 (June 2017) included the QR code reader, Android is still yet to have any built-in QR code readers. <br>
							<br>
							Whilst interviewing people I found it difficult to keep the conversation flowing once the interviewee was stuck without leveraging or influencing the outcome. To resolve this, I tried to reword or extend on the question from a broader perspective as oppose to asking more direct or context-sensitive questions. My failure to do so for a couple interviews void the experiment and weren’t used.
							Downloading a separate app to read a single message is too much of an effort for many users. The gain of using a QR code reader is simply not enough for the user to bother downloading a QR code reader.<br>
							<br>
							I found my role in this experiment to be highly directed. Andre took the role of a team leader and tended to focus on work-points and trouble shooting. Given those work-points I was able to delve into the workload and push through it in bulk. This included areas of research, data entry and transcribing. Not having certainty in where to go next or what is more valuable to the project, Andre was about to direct me.
							We worked well in terms of collaboration and communication for this project. I believe this to be partly due to the face we were familiar with each other already and because we each have plenty of experience working with groups especially the experience we’ve each had in our Research and Development team.<br>
							<br>
							Moving forward, I believe this assignment has further developed my knowledge in terms of data collection and data analysing. This extends previous learnings from Software Engineering and Research and Development. Another bonus from this assignment is gaining more experience with HTML and HTML framework.

		 <p class="flow-text center-align" style="font-size: 12pt">This assignment have enlightened me as this is my first assignment that will be actually conducting the experiment. This assignment has aimed to do a usability test on various age groups of people whether they use QR code in their daily life. It was interesting to see and interact with various age groups as their reactions on the experiment was varied from one person to another.
		 When we first started the assignment, we discussed together about the topic, and the general direction of which we should take to achieve our best grade. I believe the goal of this assignment was to let us experience scientific experiment in an academic setting so that we can learn how to do them, and interact with the community – team members, participants and etc. Overall I believe I learned some of the basic and key concepts of usability and its testing methodology.
		 The assignment will be delivered in a website to present our experiment. Fortunately all of my team members were able to create and develop and website and since they were a friendly bunch we were easily able to communicate and collaborate to create this assignment. In addition, we all had experience on Science fair type of experiment during our Intermediate so it was helpful to carry our experiment based on that experience.
			Overall this assignment will give us an experience to advance our career whether academically or business and will further our knowledge in applied human computer interaction and will overall benefit us. </p>
