					<h3>Usability</h3>
					<p class="flow-text" style="font-size: 1rem;">
						The usability of quick response (QR) codes.<br/>QR codes are a very common appearance but are they fit-for-purpose or well used? Does the use of QR code functionality make a mobile application more usable?
					</p>
					<h3>Data Collecting</h3>
					<p class="flow-text" style="font-size: 1rem;">
						In order to gather the data required we will conduct a number of interviews/experiments regarding the QR codes. We have interviewed a number of people from a broad demographic in terms of age, gender and educational background. Each interview is a verbal
						(audio recorded) 1-2 minute questionnaire of open-ended questions (audio files below).
						In order to gather the data required we will conduct a number of interviews/experiments regarding the QR codes. Interviews are both qualitative and quantitative.We have interviewed a number of people from a broad demographic in terms of age, gender and educational background. Each interview is a verbal (audio recorded) 1-2 minute questionnaire of open-ended questions (audio files below). 
						Using open-ended and reasonably context-free questions allow us to gather data from interviewees without any interference or influence such as unintentionally pushing interviewees towards an answer we want or interviewees seeing the interview as a ‘test’, changing their answers to score well. This also allowed us to gather more information with an infinite set of possible answers. Open-ended questions are more suitable in relation to the usability of QR codes however, requires more effort to analyse the data (nngroup.com/articles/open-ended-questions).

					</p>
					<h3>Adoption</h3>
					<p class="flow-text" style="font-size: 1rem;">
						In order for an interaction technique to be successfully adopted by a wide range of people, three conditions must be met:
						<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
							<li> Usefulness: The technique must provide some sort of benefit. Useless innovations are a dead-end. </li>
							<li> Ease of use: This technique has to provide some sort of benefit in terms of the learning curve and the usability of the technique once it is learnt. If the learning curve is too great or mastery of the technique requires time/effort, most will
								give up.</li>
							<li> Discoverability: The technique/technology must be discoverable by a wide population. Many useful inventions have simply been lost because of the lack of numbers to support such techniques.</li>
						</ul>

					<p class="flow-text center-align" style="font-size: 12pt">This assignment was a bit different to prior assignments I have done at AUT, similar in a way to the first assignment. I find it difficult to think in such a way that takes into consideration the end user. However over the past year through projects with clients, this paper and as well as being exposed to the User Experience department at work I have begun to understand the importance of knowing the way that users feel about and use a system. Through this assignment, I was exposed to my first experiment with a goal of understanding the users of a particular technology, in this case, QR Codes. I found it very interesting in the lectures when the discussion was around how bad questions would anchor users and how to ask questions in a way such that you wouldn't prompt them to alter the way they are feeling about a product/technology. I tried to incorporate what I learned from the lectures about anchoring into my interviews with users so that my questions would be more open to trying to make the interviewee comfortable in sharing their true thoughts on a technology.<br /> In regards to how our team performed I believe we have all been under vast amounts of pressure from our R & D Projects as well just the fact of this semester being all of our last set of papers in our degrees. I feel that this lead to us procrastinating getting started on this particular assignment in a preemptive manner, which made it difficult for us to come up with some better usability experiments. However, I feel that the topic we have researched is very interesting and I think QR Codes, especially within mobile apps need to be structured in the right way to make the applications experience benefit from including functionality involving QR Codes.<br />Something I would like to do differently in my future usability studies would be to have more open-ended sessions. Where the experiments would be based on observing how users naturally use a technology rather than the interview format we conducted which I felt masked many of the intricacies around how users interacted with QR Codes. I will take this learning into my user testings at work next week where I hope to watch users play with some of my own software (an iOS app) to see how they will try to bend and break it. This openness in trying to understand how users will naturally use a system or software tool I believe will enable me to build more intuitive and usable systems.</br/>Going forward, employing the practices and methods I have learned in this course will be vital to my success in my internship and my hopefully long career in technology. I know that user-led design and being user-centric are becoming very important within the industry and with helping to build better products. I feel that this assignment has been the first step into understanding the real ways of testing a technologies usability. I understand that I feel quite differently about usability in comparison to a regular user, in that I prefer my tools to be within a terminal with clear documentation, whereas a general user just wants to intuitively know how to use a new tool. But learning this has been a transformation I have been beginning to undertake thanks to the likes of this course, talented UX colleagues I am exposed to and the rise of user led design.</p>

		 <p class="flow-text center-align" style="font-size: 12pt">This assignment have enlightened me as this is my first assignment that will be actually conducting the experiment. This assignment has aimed to do a usability test on various age groups of people whether they use QR code in their daily life. It was interesting to see and interact with various age groups as their reactions on the experiment was varied from one person to another.
		 When we first started the assignment, we discussed together about the topic, and the general direction of which we should take to achieve our best grade. I believe the goal of this assignment was to let us experience scientific experiment in an academic setting so that we can learn how to do them, and interact with the community – team members, participants and etc. Overall I believe I learned some of the basic and key concepts of usability and its testing methodology. 
		 The assignment will be delivered in a website to present our experiment. Fortunately all of my team members were able to create and develop and website and since they were a friendly bunch we were easily able to communicate and collaborate to create this assignment. In addition, we all had experience on Science fair type of experiment during our Intermediate so it was helpful to carry our experiment based on that experience. </p>
